# QNet IR Static Website (YOUR_NAME)

## Quick setup
1. Replace placeholders:
   - YOUR_NAME
   - YOUR_IR_ID (the referral ID/query that QNet uses)
   - PHONE_NUMBER (your WhatsApp in international format without +)
   - FORM_ENDPOINT (Formspree or Mailchimp POST URL)
   - Optionally set `QNET_PRODUCT_LINK_BASE` in `script.js`.

2. Host:
   - GitHub Pages: push to a repo and enable Pages (branch `main` / `gh-pages`).
   - Netlify: drag & drop folder or connect repo.
   - Any static hosting works.

3. Forms:
   - For quick setup use [Formspree](https://formspree.io): get an endpoint and paste it into `lead.html` and `script.js` FORM_ENDPOINT.
   - Or integrate Mailchimp / ConvertKit / Odoo forms as your backend.

4. Images:
   - Replace placeholder images with official QNet product images if allowed. Do not edit QNet logos; avoid using their trademarked logosâ€”use product images only where QNet permits.

5. Compliance:
   - Always display that this is your personal site and that purchases redirect to QNet official store.
   - Do NOT show direct pricing that conflicts with QNet pricing or make income/medical claims.

## Email / WhatsApp follow-up (suggestion)
- Use Mailchimp / Odoo Email Marketing / WhatsApp Business API to run a 7-day nurture sequence (see sample messages in this project's notes).

## Need help?
If you'd like, I can:
- Customize the site with your real name, IR ID and images right here (paste the values) and I will return the edited files ready to copy.
- Convert this into a WordPress page pack or generate a zip file (I can paste zipped base64 if you want).
